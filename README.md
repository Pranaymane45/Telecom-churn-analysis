# Telecom-churn-analysis
Telecom Churn Analysis identifies customers likely to leave using **SQL** for data, **Excel** for modeling, **Python** for predictive analytics, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards, helping reduce churn and boost retention.

1️⃣ Data Extraction:
Use SQL to pull customer data (usage, billing, demographics) from telecom databases.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Exploration:
Use Python (Pandas) in Jupyter or Colab to clean data, handle missing values, and perform EDA to find churn patterns.
3️⃣ Modeling & Analysis:
Use Python to build churn prediction models (logistic regression, decision trees) and test scenarios.
4️⃣ Validation & Reporting:
Use Excel for quick scenario checks, pivot tables, and manual what-if analysis.
5️⃣ Visualization:
Use Power BI to create dashboards showing churn rates, high-risk segments, and trends over time.
6️⃣ Documentation:
Prepare BRD, FRD, and user guides for stakeholders to ensure clear understanding of churn insights.
7️⃣ Insights & Actions:
Share insights with marketing and retention teams to design targeted campaigns and reduce churn.
